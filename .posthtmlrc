The presentation states that students in Columbia College and SEAS currently experience “significant challenges securing places in key foundational courses in a number of disciplines” and have “very few open spaces conducive for building community.” Expanding the number of students in these schools, according to the findings, could “exacerbate the difficulty of bringing Core class sizes into greater alignment with our peers and our own pedagogical values.”"
